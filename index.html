          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Material UI (MUI) was created in 2014 as a special kit for React to
            unify React and Material Design. From the very beginning it offered
            a huge veriety of styled components, from atomic, like simple
            buttons, to more complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now it is not only advanced and modern framework, but also a world
            community of users and proponents of more then 4 million people.

                Material Design is a design system built and supported by Google
                designers and developers. Material.io includes in-depth UX
                guidance and UI component implementations for Android, Flutter,
                and the Web.
              </li>
              <li>
                The latest version, Material 3, enables personal, adaptive, and
                expressive experiences – from dynamic color and enhanced
                accessibility, to foundations for large screen layouts and
                design tokens.

          <h3>Material UI features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Interoperability with styling systems</li>
            <li>Pre-built components</li>
            <li>Customizable themes</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Interoperability with styling systems</h3>
          <div class="css-frameworks">
            <img src="examples/assets/bootstrap-logo.png" class="frame" />
            <img src="examples/assets/tailwind-logo.png" class="frame" />

            <img src="examples/assets/skeleton-logo.webp" class="frame" />
          </div>
          <p>
            One of the main advantages of Material UI is that it is
            interoperable with different styling systems. This interoperability
            means that developers can use the library with varying frameworks of
            CSS or even with vanilla CSS.

          <h3>Pre-built components</h3>
          <p>Offering a set of pre-built components. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Dialogs: can be used to confirm an action, or to provide
              information about a process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Icons: can be used to represent different actions, or to simply
              add some flare to your design.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grids: a powerful layout tool that can be used to create complex,
              responsive layouts
            </li>
            <li>
              Typography: is an important part of any project ( a variety of
              options to help create beautiful, readable text)

            <h3>Customizable themes</h3>
            <p>
              With a few lines of code, it’s possible to create your own theme
              or even customize individual components to get things looking just
              the way you want.
            </p>
            <p>Look below:</p>
            <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
					import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

					export default createMuiTheme({
					  palette: {
						primary: {
						  main: '#ff4400',
						},
						secondary: {
						  main: '#00bbff',
						},
					  },
					});
				</code></pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Customizable themes(2)</h3>
            <p class="material-design__text">
              Once you’ve exported your theme object, you can import it into
              your application and use it by wrapping your root component in a
              ThemeProvider component, like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code><script type="text/template">
						import React from 'react';
                        import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/styles';
                        import theme from './theme';
​
                        function App() {
                          return (
                            <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
                              <div>
                                {/* your application code here */}
                              </div>
                            </ThemeProvider>
                          );
                        }
                    </script></code></pre>
            <p class="material-design__text">
              It’s also possible to customize individual components without
              having to create a whole new theme

              Material-UI components work in isolation. They are
              self-supporting, and will only inject the styles they need to
              display. They don't rely on any global style-sheets such as
              normalize.css.
